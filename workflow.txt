🔄 Daily Workflow:
1. Read orders.json → extract delivery addresses.
2. Read inventory.json → check if all items can be fulfilled.
3. Route Optimization (e.g., OR-Tools or dummy logic).
4. Suggest restocking if inventory is low.
5. Output initial optimized route.
6. Allow user to manually adjust route (via simple UI).
7. Re-optimize based on changes.
